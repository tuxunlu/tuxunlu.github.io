I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I work with the Perception and Robotics Group and am advised by Dr. Cornelia Fermuller and Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos. My research interests span event-based vision, neuromorphic computing, and medical image analysis. I am particularly passionate about leveraging deep learning—including State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformers—to process spatio-temporal data from Dynamic Vision Sensors for low-latency tasks like gesture recognition and adverse weather de-raining. In the medical domain, I develop automated 3D segmentation pipelines for 7T MRI and multi-view mammography to assist in disease diagnosis and risk prediction.
